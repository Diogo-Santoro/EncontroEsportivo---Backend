# EncontroEsportivo

  The final paper of my IT technical course. Started at FIEC (Indaiatuba), EncontroSportivo is a project where users can schedule to play sports games in a designated place, with other users, facilitating a possible better quality of life and encouraging the practice of sports. We used Java (with Spring as Framework).
  It is currently in the cloud and can be accessed through the url.
